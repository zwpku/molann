# This is a comment line.

# Lines that describe a feature contain several fields, seperated by comma.

# The first and the second fields specify the name and the
# type_name of the feature, respectively. The remaining fields specify
# the strings for selection to define an atom group by concatenation.

# Note: to keep the order of atoms, use 'bynum 5, bynum 2', instead of 'bynum 5 2'
